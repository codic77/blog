# A guide on how to install Linux

Here's how you install Linux, a popular OS kernel which respects your privacy.
1. Choose a distro. Distros are variations of the Linux kernel with their own customizations. I can't really recommend a specific one, but there's a ton of information online; use that.
2. If you want to try a distro, you'll probably want to run it in a VM first. This can be accomplished by making a VM in software like VirtualBox or VMWare, which will isolate the Linux installation from your current Windows/OSX installation. It'll also be slow, unless you give it a significant amount of RAM which will slow down your main operating system, so you shouldn't use a VM as your daily driver (unless you have a VERY powerful machine, of course)
3. Once you have a distro you love, you can burn it to a USB, boot from it, and choose to either dualboot it (install it alongside your current OS), or erase your disk and install it.
